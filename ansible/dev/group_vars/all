# File:    ansible/dev/group_vars/all
# Purpose: variable definitions for all aws ec2 instances

# Because the ansible/main.yml is expecting an {{ environment_user }} for the remote_user parameter
#  add an explicit environment_user definition here to keep the playbook and command line simple
# This should really be revisited as it maybe isn't the nicest or cleanest way of handling different
#  environment users.
