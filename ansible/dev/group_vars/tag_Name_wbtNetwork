# File:    dev/group_vars/tag_Name_example-python3-appserver
# Purpose: variable declarations applicable to all local Vagrant dev hosts in the wbtNetwork example app's appservers group

# local development environment options
# Allows development environments to use a local artifact file path instead of attempting to download one from Artifactory:
#  - Install directory cleanup is disabled by default as enabling will cause a running application to break - when set
#     the variable will cause an existing application install directory to be deleted if it has the same build number as
#     the local package under deployment. Useful in scenarios when a clean install of an existing build is to be tested
#      and the state of any running application is not a concern.
#  - Deployable artifact file path defaults to the default mounted /vagrant share directory on a local Vagrant VM. Can be
#     changed / overriden as required for individual environment configurations.
